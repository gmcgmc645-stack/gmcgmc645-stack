# About me 👋


**gmcgmc645-stack/gmcgmc645-stack** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I’m currently working on small c++ projects that spark my interest.
- I’m currently learning c++
- I’m looking for help with motivation.
- Fun fact: I'm named after a car.
